## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to implement and test a Python function for counting anagrams in a given text. The focus is on writing tests first and developing a robust, efficient solution.

## Task Description
The goal is to implement a function `count_anagrams(text, word)` that counts all occurrences of anagrams of the word in the text.

### Example:
```python
text = "forxxorfxdofr"
word = "for"
# Output: 3 (anagrams: "for", "orf", "ofr")
```

## Project Structure
- **`word_tools.py`**: Contains the `count_anagrams` function.
- **`test_count_anagrams.py`**: Contains unit tests for `count_anagrams`.

## Setup

1. **Install Required Tools**:
   - Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
   - Install `pytest` for testing:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     ```

2. **Clone Repository**:
   - Create a private GitHub repository.
   - Clone the repository locally and open it in your IDE.

3. **File Setup**:
   - Create `word_tools.py` for the implementation.
   - Create `test_count_anagrams.py` for unit tests.
